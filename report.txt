Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server fakestoreapi.com. 

10 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 4.4 And Total Concurrent API requested: 290.
50 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 23 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1450.
100 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 35 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2900.

While executed 100 concurrent request, found 1 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.03%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 95 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
